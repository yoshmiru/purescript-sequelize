-- | There are two different data types defined in this module that can be
-- | used for 'where' clauses: `WHERE` and `Where`. `WHERE` is simpler to use,
-- | and so it is not as powerful. For example:
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | myWhere :: WHERE Car
-- | myWhere = WHERE ["make" /\ String "BMW", "horsepower" /\ Int 600]
-- | ```
-- | will match any row with a make column equal to the string "BMW" and a
-- | horsepower column equal to 600.
-- |
-- | The `Where` type is more powerful, and you generally don't need to use
-- | the type constructor: just use the provided combinators.
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | myWhere :: Where Car
-- | myWhere = "make" $/= String "Audi" $& "horsepower" $<= 400
-- | ```
-- | will match any row in the table where the make isn't an Audi and the
-- | horsepower is less than or equal to 400.
